# Neos backlit MacBook lid sticker

## How to print

Actually this is not printed but cut out out of a foil with a plotter.
Make sure to use a foil that is opaque. Use a really dark, grey foil which is not glossy, but dull.

IMPORTANT: The final sticker needs to be 60x60mm to match the apple logo on the lid.

Make sure the sticker is produced with a transferfoil, to ensure an easy application to your lid ;)

## How to put on

Clean you lid. Remove dirt, grease and coffee stains.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the N is upright when the lid is open. Please double-check with the SVG.

Use a plastic card to apply the logo to the lid. Start with on edge and slowly advance to the opposite edge. Make sure to swipe out all air bubbles.

Have fun and admire.
